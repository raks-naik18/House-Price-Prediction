## House Price Prediction
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning techniques based on historical data. It leverages multiple features related to the properties and uses regression models to estimate the final sale price.

## Introduction
House price prediction is a classic problem in the field of machine learning. In this project, we apply various regression models to predict house prices based on factors such as location, size, and various other property attributes.The goal is to build an accurate model that can generalize well on unseen data.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for building the models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and experimentation.

## Dataset
